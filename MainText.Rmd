# Body

This is the main text. You can cite external papers which are also catalogued in REF_ALL.bib 
[@burnham2003_modelselection]. You can cite sections (section \ref{SM-sect:res}) in the
supporting information file, and also figures (figure \ref{SM-fig:datplot}) and tables 
(table \ref{SM-tab:dat}), just preface the label by the tag "SM-". 

Normally there are no computations done in this Rmd, results created by running SuppMat.Rmd 
are simply imported. We here import the same figure used in the supporting information, 
although it makes no narrative sense, just to have a demo:

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=6in]{./results/testfig.pdf}
\caption{Main text version of the same figure that appears in supporting information.}
\label{fig:mtversion}
\end{figure}

So we can refer to the version here (figure \ref{fig:mtversion}) or to the version in 
the supporting information (figure \ref{SM-fig:datplot}).
